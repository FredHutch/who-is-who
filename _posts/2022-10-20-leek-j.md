I'm a Professor in the Biostatistics Program in the PHS Division, the Chief Data Officer, and lead the [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab])(https://hutchdatascience.org/). I do research in computational genomics - focused on epidemiology-scale transcriptomics - but am increasingly working on translational machine learning. I'm open to collaborations and mentoring!
