I'm an HPC/Cloud Systems engineer in
[Scientific Computing](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/comp_index/).

I can help with cluster & cloud computing questions,
web application development & deployment, R and 
Python scripting questions, and more.

The best way to contact me, or another SciComp member,
is to email `scicomp@`.
