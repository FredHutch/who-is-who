I'm a Staff Scientist in [Harmit Malik's lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/malik/en.html) in the Basic Sciences Division. We're a research lab focussed on evolution and we study a wide range of topics, including how viruses interact with host immunity, chromatin biology (especially in Drosophila) and bacterial/fungal interactions. I provide bioinformatics support to our lab, performing analyses myself as well as providing mentorship for our lab members and others. My expertise includes standard genomics assays (RNA-seq, SNP-calling, etc) as well as a lot of sequence database searching, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics and analysis of evolutionary selective pressures.
