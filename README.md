This is a who's who repo that renders a site at [whoiswho.fredhutch.org](https://whoiswho.fredhutch.org) for collaborations that can be seen on the Hutch network only and is in a private repo to the Fred Hutch.  


## How to contribute

If you'd like to be listed in our Who's Who Directory and are familiar with using GitHub, this is how you can contribute:

- fork the repository and make a branch,
> NOTE: If you are part of the All Fred Hutch GitHub team, you should not need to fork the repo before making your branch if you don't want to.  
- copy the template post (template.md) into the folder called `_posts`, 
- customize it,
- and then do a pull request and we will review it for formatting prior to merging it!

What is a little fiddly in this markdown is the "front matter" which is the text inside the triple dashes.  This section needs to be formatted very specifically, and is where you'll be specifying which "tags" describe your work and "categories" you fall into.  Keep in mind these are case and space sensitive, so ideally all keywords would be fully lowercase unless they are an acronym themselves.  

Like this:

```
---
title: "Amy Pagurigan, PhD"
tags:
  - genomics
  - R
  - shiny
  - WDL
  - workflows
  - cloud
  - single cell
categories: 
  - collaborate
  - mentor
  - consult
---
```

In this case, the "tags" are rendered on the site as "Keywords" and include keywords about the data types, analysis approaches, tools and platforms you use in your work.  The "categories" are rendered on teh site as "Roles" and include keywords about what kind of role you're interested in playing if another researcher were to contact you.  

### Essential information
While we do hope people customize their listing however they'd like, the following are the essential components we will require everyone to contribute on their listing.  

1.  Your name
2.  Your primary institutional affiliation (e.g. FHCC, UW, Children's)
3.  A list of keywords that describe your interests (e.g., genomics, R, metabolomics, statistics)
4.  A list of keywords that describe what roles you're interested in playing (e.g., mentor, consultant, collaborator)
5.  A short blurb about your work, who you are and most importantly, how you'd like people to contact you!
