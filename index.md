This page is a pilot project that is a collaboration between the Fred Hutch Translational Data Science IRC and the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab.  It's intended to serve as an evolving resource to foster connections between Fred Hutch and other Cancer Consortium staff members and each other as well as the wider world. 


Find out who's who in Fred Hutch Data, organized by [role](/roles/) or by [keyword](/keywords/).

Are you a Fred Hutch or Cancer Consortium staff member interested in data science and data intensive collaborations?  Would you like to be listed here?  

If you are familiar with using GitHub, you can find the specific instructions [here](https://github.com/FredHutch/who-is-who).  If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can email us at data@fredhutch.org and a member of the Fred Hutch Translational Data Science IRC or the Data Science Lab will help get you listed.  

[This is our current post template](https://github.com/FredHutch/who-is-who/template.md), so whether you are managing your own listing or going to ask for help, you'll need to have this information handy:


1.  Your name
2.  Your primary institutional affiliation (e.g. FHCC, UW, Children's)
3.  A list of keywords that describe your interests (e.g., genomics, R, metabolomics, statistics)
4.  A list of keywords that describe what roles you're interested in playing (e.g., mentor, consultant, collaborator)
5.  A short blurb about your work, who you are and most importantly, how you'd like people to contact you!
