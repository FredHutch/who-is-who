## What is this Project? 
This page is a pilot project that is a collaboration between the [Fred Hutch Translational Data Science IRC](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/institutes-networks-ircs/translational-data-science-integrated-research-center.html) and the [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab](https://hutchdatascience.org/).  It's intended to serve as an evolving resource to foster connections between Fred Hutch and other Cancer Consortium staff members and each other as well as the wider world. 


## How to participate
If you are familiar with using GitHub, you can find instructions [here](https://github.com/FredHutch/who-is-who).  If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can email us at `data@fredhutch.org` and a member of the Fred Hutch Translational Data Science IRC or the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab will help get you listed.  

[This is our current post template](https://github.com/FredHutch/who-is-who/blob/main/template.md).  Whether you are managing your own listing or going to ask for help, you'll need to have this information handy:


1.  Your name
2.  Your primary institutional affiliation (e.g. FHCC, UW, Children's)
3.  A list of keywords that describe your interests (e.g., genomics, R, metabolomics, statistics)
4.  A list of keywords that describe what roles you're interested in playing (e.g., mentor, consultant, collaborator)
5.  A short blurb about your work, what lab you are in if you're a mentee, who you are and most importantly, how you'd like people to contact you!
